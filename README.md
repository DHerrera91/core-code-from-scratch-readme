## Let´s make a pizza:

### Stablish the pizza dough ingredients

1. 1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)
2. 1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast
3. 3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour
4. 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)
5. 2 teaspoons kosher salt
6. 1 teaspoon sugar

### Stablish the pizza ingredients

1.Extra virgin olive oil
2. Cornmeal (to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone)
3.Tomato sauce (smooth or pureed)
4. Firm mozzarella cheese, grated
5. Fresh soft mozzarella cheese, separated into small clumps
6. Fontina cheese, grated
7. Parmesan cheese, grated
8. Feta cheese, crumbled
9. Mushrooms, very thinly sliced if raw, otherwise first sautéed
10. Bell peppers, stems and seeds removed, very thinly sliced
11. Italian pepperoncini, thinly sliced
12. Italian sausage, cooked ahead and crumbled
13. Sliced black olives
14. Chopped fresh basil

### Prepare the dough
1. Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer.
2. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
3. After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely.
4. Add flour
5. Add salt
6. Add sugar
7. Add olive oil
8. Mix the ingredients
9. Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed
10. Let the dough rise
11. Preheat the pizza stone
12. Divide the dough into 2 balls
13. Prep the toppings
14. Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round
15. Brush the dough top with olive oil
16. Sprinkle the pizza peel with cornmeal, put flattened dough on top
17. Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings
18. Slide pizza into the oven
19. Bake pizza in the 475°F oven until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes

## Hot N Cold :

###Celcius to Fahrenheit
1.Check in which temperature scale is the value
2.if the value is in celsius
3.multiply by 1.8
4.add 32
5.get the result
6.present the result in fharenheit
7.if the value is in fahrenheit
8.subtract 32
9.multiply by .5556
10.get the result
11.present the result in celsius

## Some geometry

1. Ask wich of the followings is the volume you need. (cube, pyramid , sphere)
2.If is a cube:
2.1Ask the length of one side
2.2Since it is supposed to be the same in the three sides multiply by 3.
2.3Print the value calculated for the volume
3.If is a sphere:
3.1Ask for the radius value
3.2The volume value is equal to 4/3 * pi * r^3
3.3Print volume value
4.If is a pyramid:
4.1Ask the length of the base
4.2Ask the width of the base
4.3Ask the height of the pyramid
4.4Multiply length by width to get the area
4.5Multiply the area by the height
4.6Multiply (area*height)*1/3
4.5Print the volume value
